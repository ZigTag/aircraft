## Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)
Welcome to the electronic flight bag implementation!

### ~~Testing~~
~~You can run a standalone version of the EFB by running the following:~~

```
$ npm install
$ npm run serve:efb
```

~~Then, navigate to http://localhost:10001.~~

~~The native resolution of the EFB in the sim is 1430x1000.~~

~~In Chrome and Firefox dev tools, enable Responsive Design Mode (tablet and phone icon) and select this resolution to display it as it would appear in the sim.~~

Sadly with the addition of SimVar editing to the EFB you are unable to run the EFB in the browser.
Furthermore, with the new addition of instrument-sdk it entirely doesn't work without a heavily modified (and special fork) of a program like [ace-v3](https://github.com/synapticsim/ace-v3).
